Task 17 - 2/2
As the first thing, create a copy of the file othello-16.py and rename it to othello-17.py. Then make the following changes in the new file:

Add a new attribute zone_green as described on the previous page, and initialize it in the constructor with [[2, 0], [2, 2], [0, 2], [5, 0], [5, 2], [7, 2], [0, 5], [2, 5], [2, 7], [5, 7], [5, 5], [7, 5]]. Add a new attribute zone_side to represent the four central squares in the middle of each side (16 positions total). Initialize it in the constructor with [[2, 0], [3, 0], [4, 0], [5, 0], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [2, 7], [3, 7], [4, 7], [5, 7], [7, 2], [7, 3], [7, 4], [7, 5]]. Also add a new attribute zone_center to represent the 4 x 4 central area of the board (16 positions total). Initialize it in the constructor using a pair of nested for loops. Note: Some of the zones overlap. This makes it easier to experiment with various strategies by combining the zones differently, leaving some of them out, etc.  

Erase the body of strategy2() and copy the body of strategy1() there. Towards the end, before copying moves into legal_moves and calling strategy0(), try to place a disc into the 4 x 4 central part of the board (list zone_center). If that's not possible, try to put a disc into the green zone (list zone_green). If thatâ€™s not possible, try to put a disc into the central part of any side (list zone_side). In the main program, set Player 1 to beginner and Player 2 to 'advanced':

R.set_player_strategy(1, 'beginner')
R.set_player_strategy(2, 'advanced')
R.set_player_strategy(1, 'beginner')
R.set_player_strategy(2, 'advanced')
